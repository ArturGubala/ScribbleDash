## About the Game

**ScribbleDash** is a casual Android game that challenges players to quickly recreate AI-generated drawings from memory. At the start of each round, a reference image is shown for **3 seconds**. Once it disappears, the player must redraw it as accurately as possible based only on memory.

The game combines speed, observation, and creativity, offering multiple game modes and difficulty levels for high replayability.
